**SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT**

In this project, I uploaded PPC campaign data via a CSV file and stored it in a Supabase database. I calculated key KPIs (CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, ROAS) and created a visual and interactive dashboard using Looker Studio. I also added filters and charts to make the campaign performance easier to interpret and analyze.
