 # Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for PPC Campaign Analysis
Click-Through Rate (CTR)
Definition: The Click-Through Rate (CTR) represents the ratio of users who clicked on an advertisement to the number of total users who viewed the ad (impressions).
Significance: A higher CTR indicates that the ad content and audience targeting are effective, drawing users' attention and prompting engagement.
Formula:
CTR = Clicks / Impressions

Cost Per Click (CPC)
Definition: Cost Per Click (CPC) refers to the average amount paid for each click generated by the advertisement.
Significance: CPC is essential for understanding the cost-efficiency of ad campaigns, enabling budget control and platform performance comparisons.
Formula:
CPC = Spend / Clicks

Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)
Definition: Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) measures the average cost incurred to acquire a single conversion (e.g., a sale, lead, or other desired user action).
Significance: This KPI is critical for assessing campaign profitability and helps in optimizing advertising spend toward high-performing strategies.
Formula:
CPA = Spend / Conversions

Conversion Rate
Definition: The Conversion Rate indicates the proportion of ad clicks that result in a successful conversion.
Significance: This metric reflects the effectiveness of post-click experiences, such as landing pages and offers, in persuading users to take the desired action.
Formula:
Conversion Rate = Conversions / Clicks

Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
Definition: Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) quantifies the revenue generated for every unit of currency spent on advertising.
Significance: ROAS is a core profitability metric, used to evaluate the financial return and effectiveness of advertising investments.
