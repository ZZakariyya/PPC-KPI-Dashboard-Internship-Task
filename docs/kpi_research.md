# KPI Research

Document your research on relevant PPC KPIs here. 

Below I listed 5 important PPC (Pay-Per-Click) KPIs that I selected for this project after some research. Each KPI can be calculated using the given dataset and, as I found, these are the commonly used ones to evaluate ad performance in digital marketing campaigns.

### 1. Click-Through Rate (CTR)

- **Formula:** CTR = Clicks ÷ Impressions  
- **Meaning:** CTR shows what percentage of users clicked the ad after seeing it. It tells us how good and relevant the ad was in engaging the people.  
- **Importance:** A high CTR means the ad successfully attracted attention and more users to interact.

### 2. Conversion Rate (CVR)

- **Formula:** CVR = Conversions ÷ Clicks  
- **Meaning:** CVR tells us how many of the users who clicked on the ad actually completed a desired action (like a purchase).  
- **Importance:** It helps to measure how effective the ad and its landing page are for generating results.

### 3. Cost Per Click (CPC)

- **Formula:** CPC = Spend ÷ Clicks  
- **Meaning:** CPC gives the average amount of money spent for each click.  
- **Importance:** A lower CPC means the campaign is more cost-efficient for generating traffic.

### 4. Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

- **Formula:** CPA = Spend ÷ Conversions  
- **Meaning:** CPA shows how much is spent to get one conversion.  
- **Importance:** It’s very crucial for budget planning and understanding how much it costs to gain a customer.

### 5. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

- **Formula:** ROAS = Revenue ÷ Spend  
- **Meaning:** ROAS shows how much revenue the company earn for every dollar they spend.  
- **Importance:** It tells whether the campaign is profitable or not. If the ROAS > 1, it means the company is earning more than it spends.
